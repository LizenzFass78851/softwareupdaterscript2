# Software Updater Script 2
Is a script that the supported software can be updated via the task planning of windows

- to use the script, simply put the script in any folder.
- then put the * .exe of the firefox setup or the * .msp file from adobe reader dc in the same folder.
- then create task planning in windows (the task is best carried out as a system when the system is started)
- In this case the script installs an update of firefox and adobe reader dc and then deletes the setups used for this.
- The script also allows possibilities if you want to update more than just firefox and the adobe reader dc. (you have to write the parameters yourself if you want)

# Out NOW - The XL variant 
There is now the optional additional script softwareupdaterXL.bat.
- The difference is that the XL variant now installs more software than just firefox or the reader dc silent.
