# Software Updater Script 2
Is a script that the supported software can be updated via the task planning of windows

- to use the script, simply put the script in any folder.
- then put the * .exe of the firefox setup or the * .msp file from adobe reader dc in the same folder.
- then create task planning in windows (the task is best carried out as a system when the system is started)
- In this case the script installs an update of firefox and adobe reader dc and then deletes the setups used for this.
- The script also allows possibilities if you want to update more than just firefox and the adobe reader dc. (you have to write the parameters yourself if you want)

## Out NOW - The XL variant 
There is now the optional additional script softwareupdaterXL.bat.
- The difference is that the XL variant now installs more software than just firefox or the reader dc silent.

The silent install is supported according to the same principle as explained above:
